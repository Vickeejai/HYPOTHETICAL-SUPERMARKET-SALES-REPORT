### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation stage, we performed the following tasks:
 1. Data Inspection

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis involved exploring the sales data to answer some key questions such as:

1. What challenges could the hypothetical company be facing?
2. What are the top performing products across Branches A, B, and C?
3. Relate revenue generated with sales date tremd and the gross margin percentage.
4. What is the customer purchasing behaviour with respect to membership status and gender?
5. What products are the customers most and least satisfied with?
6. Analyze the payment method preference
7. Suggest recommendations that can improve the company in terms of revenue, customer behaviour and satisfaction.

### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The supermarket is having challenges in identifying top-performing products, understanding customer purchasing behaviors, assessing the effectiveness of different payment methods, and optimizing its operational efficiency.
2. Branch A has its highest revenue coming from Homes and Lifestyle, Branch B from Sports and Travel, and Branch C from Food and Beverages.
3. After analyzing the sales date trend given the revenue gotten across different time periods, the company is generating no significant revenue. From the Gross Margin Percentage analysis, Branch A has more revenue from Food and Beverages, Branch B has from Home and Lifestyle, and Branch C has from Sports and Travel.
4. Based on the purchasing behaviour of customers:
   - Female Customers with no membership status across different branches made high revenue in Electronics Accessories and Fashion Accessories.
   - Female Customers with membership status across different branches made high revenue in Food and Beverages, Home and Lifestyle.
   - Male Customers with no membership status across different branches made high revenue in Sports and Travel and Electronics Accessories.
   - Male Customers with membership status across different branches made high revenue in Health and Safety and Electronics Accessories.
5. Based on Customer Stisfaction:
   - Female customers with no membership status gave Sports and Travel the least rating while those with membership status gave Food and Beverages the least rating.
   - Female customers with no membership status gave Electronic Accessories the highest rating while those with membership status gave Sports and Travel the highest rating.
   - Male customers with no membership status gave Fashion and Accessories the least rating while those with membership status gave Health and Beauty, and Food and Beverages the least rating.
   - Female customers with no membership status gave Sports and Travel the highest rating while those with membership status gave no rating of 10 to any product line.
6. Based on the Payment preference of customers:
   - As seen from the analysis, the ratings for payment preferences are very inconsistent. Although, poor ratings are seen more on Cash Payment. Also both female and male customers that gave a rating of 4 was more of Credit cards, and E-wallet on both Sports and Travel and Health and Beauty.
   - Both female and male customers that gave a 6 to 10 rating preferred paying with Credit Cards and E-wallet on more Product lines.

 1. Setting benchmarks and performance targets for each branch while reviewing its operating expenses regularly.
 2. Negotiate better prices or payment terms with suppliers to reduce the cost of goods sold.
 3. Purchase materials in bulk to take advantage of volume discounts.
 4. Focus on high-margin products and consider discontinuing low-margin ones.
 5. Have SMART detailed action plans for each strategy.
 6. Enhance customer service by training employees on customer service best practices like resolving issues promptly and effectively.
 7. Source high-quality products and conduct regular quality checks to improve product quality. 
 8. Maintain transparency and showcase positive customer testimonials and reviews to build brand reputation
 9. Have a user-friendly website or app with fast and reliable delivery service, and easy return and exchange policies.
 10. Adopt Digital Payment Methods as they provide valuable data that can be analyzed for insights into customer behavior, purchasing patterns, and payment preferences.
 11. Also we recommend conducting surveys while continuously monitoring payment trends and adapting to new technologies and customer preferences as they evolve.
 12. Regularly review progress against objectives and adjust strategies as needed.
