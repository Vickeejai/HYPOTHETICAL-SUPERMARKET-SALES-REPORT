### Project Overview

The dataset from January to March 2019 shows sales transactions across various product categories, customer demographics, and locations for a hypothetical supermarket. The data analysis project seeks to review the financial performance of the supermarket while uncovering insights to increase profitability

### Data Sources

Sales Data: The primary dataset used for this analysis is "C:\Users\PC\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Network Shortcuts\Sales Analysis for Hypothetical Supermarket.xlsx" file, containing detailed information about each sale made by the company

### Tools

 - Excel - Data Cleaning, Analysis, and Reporting [Download here](https://microsoft.com)
 - PowerPoint - Report Presentation

### Data Cleaning

In the initial data preparation stage, we performed the following tasks:
 1. Data Inspection

### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis involved exploring the sales data to answer some key questions such as:

 - What challenges could the hypothetical company be facing?
 - What are the top performing products across Branches A, B, and C?
 - Outline the specific goals you aim to achieve through your analysis.
 - What insights do you hope to uncover?
 - How will these insights benefit the company?

### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
 - The supermarket is having challenges in identifying top-performing products, understanding customer purchasing behaviors, assessing the effectiveness of different payment methods, and optimizing its operational efficiency.
 - Branch A has its highest revenue coming from Homes and Lifestyle, Branch B from Sports and Travel, and Branch C from Food and Beverages.
 - After analyzing the sales date trend given the revenue gotten across different time periods, the company is generating no significant revenue. From the Gross Margin Percentage analysis, Branch A has more revenue from Food and Beverages, Branch B has from Home and Lifestyle, and Branch C has from Sports and Travel.

As seen from the analysis, the ratings for payment preferences are very inconsistent. Although, poor ratings are seen more on Cash Payment. Also both female and male customers that gave a rating of 4 was more of Credit cards, and E-wallet on both Sports and Travel and Health and Beauty.
