### Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis involved exploring the sales data to answer some key questions such as:

1. What challenges could the hypothetical company be facing?
2. What are the top performing products across Branches A, B, and C?
3. Relate revenue generated with sales date tremd and the gross margin percentage.
4. What is the customer purchasing behaviour with respect to membership status and gender?
5. Analyze the payment method preference
6. What insights do you hope to uncover?
7. How will these insights benefit the company?

### Results

The analysis results are summarized as follows:
1. The supermarket is having challenges in identifying top-performing products, understanding customer purchasing behaviors, assessing the effectiveness of different payment methods, and optimizing its operational efficiency.
2. Branch A has its highest revenue coming from Homes and Lifestyle, Branch B from Sports and Travel, and Branch C from Food and Beverages.
3. After analyzing the sales date trend given the revenue gotten across different time periods, the company is generating no significant revenue. From the Gross Margin Percentage analysis, Branch A has more revenue from Food and Beverages, Branch B has from Home and Lifestyle, and Branch C has from Sports and Travel.
4. Based on the purchasing behaviour of customers:
   - Female Customers with no membership status across different branches made high revenue in Electronics Accessories and Fashion Accessories.

   - Male Customers with no membership status across different branches made high revenue in Sports and Travel and Electronics Accessories.
   - Male Customers with membership status across different branches made high revenue in Health and Safety and Electronics Accessories.
5. Based on Customer Stisfaction:

   - Female customers with no membership status gave Electronic Accessories the highest rating while those with membership status gave Sports and Travel the highest rating.
   - Male customers with no membership status gave Fashion and Accessories the least rating while those with membership status gave Health and Beauty, and Food and Beverages the least rating.
   - Female customers with no membership status gave Sports and Travel the highest rating while those with membership status gave no rating of 10 to any product line.
